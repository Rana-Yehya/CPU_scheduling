# CPU_scheduling
A C code for FCFS and RR algorithm
Without the calculations of time
You may need to change the file name in read_file function to your file name
This code takes four sections as follows
// Arrival time of the process  // CPU time  //I\O time   // ID of the process

 //number 1                     //number 2   //number 3   //number 4
 //number 5                     //number 6   //number 7   //number 8
 
  //And so on
  
  
 Please pay attention that you can not enter a number of two or more decimal number
 I am working on this code to make it more generic
 Enjoy it;
